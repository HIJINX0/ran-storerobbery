Let me be absolutely clear; I do not assert ownership of this script, nor do I seek acknowledgment or assistance. The script itself is a testament to Ran's dedication and talent, and it would be a tragedy for it to fall into disuse. Thus, I've made the decision to share it with the community, to ensure that Ran's work lives on and continues to benefit others.

Ran, may you rest in peace, and your legacy endure through the continued use and appreciation of your remarkable script.
